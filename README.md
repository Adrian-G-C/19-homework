# Text Editor
## Homework Challenge 19

## Description

For our 19th homework assignment we were tasked with editing the starter code for a text editor built into our browser.

## Instalation

The application is deployed on heroku, so there is no instalation required.

## Usage

The application can be used as a tex editor in your local browser. I can also be downloaded on to your machine from the link on the initial page.

## Credits
